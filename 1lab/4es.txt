## 4- Write a program that read two integer inputs (the lenghts of two segments),
##    and computes (and prints) both the area and perimeter of a rectangle (in m2).
print("====== ESERCIZIO 4 =====")
a = input("Write an integer "    )
b = input("Write an another integer "    )
a = int(a) ; b = int(b)
area = a*b
perimeter = 2*a + 2*b
print("The area of the rectangle is: ", area)
print("The perimeter of the rectangle is: ", perimeter)
